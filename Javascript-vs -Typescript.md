# Javascript vs TypeScript
some key differences between JavScript and Typescript

### Typing
Javascript is dynamically typed while typescript is statically typed with optional dynamic typing.

### Error Detection
In Javascript, errors are detected at runtime while in Typescript errors are detected at compile time.

### Tooling 
JavaScript has a basic support of code completion and debugging while TypeScript has enhanced IDE support with autocompletion, type-checking, and better refactoring tools.

### Compilation
Javascript runs directly in the browser without the need for compilation while Typescript needs to be converted to Javascript before execution in the browser.
